In a nutshell he differentiates two cases:%0a## The possible vulnerability isn't already known publicly: In this case please contact Pm by private mail.%0a## The possible vulnerability is already known publicly: In this case feel free to discuss the vulnerability in public (e.g. on [[http://www.pmichaud.com/mailman/listinfo/pmwiki-users | pmwiki-users]]).%0aSee [[http://pmichaud.com/pipermail/pmwiki-users/2006-September/031793.html | his post mentioned above]] for details and rationals.%0a%0aQ: What about the botnet security advisory at %25newwin%25[[http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=1672]]?%0a%0aA: Sites that are running with PHP's ''register_globals'' setting set to "On" and versions of PmWiki prior to 2.1.21 may be vulnerable to a botnet exploit that is taking advantage of a bug in PHP.  The vulnerability can be closed by turning ''register_globals'' off, upgrading to PmWiki 2.1.21 or later, or upgrading to PHP versions 4.4.3 or 5.1.4.  [[%3c%3c]]In addition, there is a test at [[PmWiki:SiteAnalyzer]] that can be used to determine if your site is vulnerable.%0a%0a[[#wikivandalism]]%0a!!
