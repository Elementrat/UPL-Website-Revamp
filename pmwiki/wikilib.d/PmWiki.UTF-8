text=Summary: Enabling UTF-8 Unicode language encoding in your wiki. %0a%0aUTF-8 supports all languages and alphabets, including Asian languages and their character depth.  It is a widely supported and flexible character encoding, used for many European languages and can also represent Chinese, Japanese and Korean. %0a%0aIt's fairly simple to enable UTF-8 on your wiki pages. Current PmWiki versions have the UTF-8 file which needs to be enabled.%0a%0a!! Enabling UTF-8 on a new wiki%0a%0aIf you start a new wiki in any language with the latest PmWiki version, it is highly recommended to enable UTF-8. In the future, PmWiki will change to use the UTF-8 encoding by default, so if you already use it, you will not need a complex "migration" to UTF-8 later.%0a%0aTo enable UTF-8 for a new wiki, add this line near the beginning of config.php:%0a%0a  include_once("scripts/xlpage-utf-8.php");%0a%0aThis line should come ''before'' a call to the XLPage() function in [[internationalizations|international wikis]].%0a%0a!! Enabling UTF-8 on existing wikis%0a%0aCurrently, this is possible ''only if your group and page ''names'', as well as upload names, don't contain international characters''. The names of wiki pages are used as file names, and we don't have yet an easy way to rename the disk files.%0a%0aIf your wiki doesn't have international page/file names, first [[upgrade(s)]] to the latest PmWiki version. To enable UTF-8, add these lines near the beginning of config.php:%0a%0a  include_once("scripts/xlpage-utf-8.php");%0a  $DefaultPageCharset = array(''=>'ISO-8859-1'); # see below%0a%0aThese lines should come ''before'' a call to the XLPage() function in [[internationalizations|international wikis]].%0a%0aThe $DefaultPageCharset line is there to fix and correctly handle some pages with missing or wrong attributes, created by older PmWiki versions.%0a%0a* Most wikis in European languages are likely to be in the ISO-8859-1 encoding and should use:\\%0a  @@$DefaultPageCharset = array(''=>'ISO-8859-1');@@%0a* Wikis in Czech and Hungarian language are likely to be in the ISO-8859-2 encoding, they should use this line instead:\\%0a  @@ $DefaultPageCharset = array(''=>'ISO-8859-2', 'ISO-8859-1'=>'ISO-8859-2'); @@%0a* Wikis in Turkish language are likely to be in the ISO-8859-9 encoding, they should use this line instead:\\%0a  @@ $DefaultPageCharset = array(''=>'ISO-8859-9', 'ISO-8859-1'=>'ISO-8859-9'); @@%0a%0a%0aYou should also delete the file @@ wiki.d/.pageindex@@. This file contains a cache of links and words from your pages and is used for searches and pagelists. PmWiki will rebuild it automatically with the new encoding.%0a%0a!!
