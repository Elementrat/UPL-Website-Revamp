text=(:Audience: authors (basic) :)%0a(:Summary: Organising pages into related groups:)%0a(:keywords trailing dot, trailing slash, default group:)%0aPmWiki pages are organized into groups of related pages.  This feature was added to PmWiki to allow authors to create their own ''wiki spaces'' of specialized content on their own, without having to become, or rely on, wiki administrators.  See [[http://pmichaud.com/|Pm]]'s [[http://pmichaud.com/pipermail/pmwiki-users/2006-March/024838.html|post]] to the pmwiki-users [[mailing list(s)]].%0a%0aBy default, page [[links]] are between pages of the same group; to create a link to a page in another group, add the name of the other group and a dot or slash to the page name.  For example, links to [=Main/WikiSandbox=] could be written as:%0a%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0a* [[Main.WikiSandbox]]%0a* [[Main/WikiSandbox]]%0a* [[(Main.Wiki)Sandbox]]%0a* [[Main.WikiSandbox | link text]]%0a* [[Main.WikiSandbox | +]]%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aTo link to the [[#groupdefaultpage | default home page]] of a group, the name of the page can be omitted, like this:%0a%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0a* [[Main.]]%0a* [[Main/]]%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0a!! Creating groups%0aCreating a new group is as easy as [[creating new pages]]; simply edit an existing page to include a [[link(s)]] to the new group's default home page  (or any page in the new group) then click on the '?' to edit the page. As a rule, group names must start with a letter (but this can be changed by the wiki administrator by adding %0a-> @@[@$GroupPattern = '[[:upper:]\\d][\\w]*(?:-\\w+)*';@]@@%0ain config.php).%0a%0aFor example, to make a default page in the group Foo, create a link to [=[[Foo/]]=] (or [=[[Foo.]]=]).  %0aTo make a page called Bar in the group Foo, create a link to [=[[Foo/Bar]]=] and follow the link to edit that page.%0a%0a!! Groups in a standard PmWiki distribution%0a* [[Main]]: The default group. On many wikis, it contains most of the author-contributed content. Main.HomePage and Main.WikiSandbox come pre-installed.%0a* [[PmWiki]]: An edit-protected group that contains PmWiki documentation and help pages.%0a* [[Site]]: Holds a variety of utility and configuration pages used by PmWiki, including [[%3c%3c]][=SideBar=], Search, Preferences, Templates, and [=AllRecentChanges=].%0a* [[SiteAdmin/]]: Holds a number of password protected administration and configuration pages used by PmWiki, including [[%3c%3c]] [=ApprovedUrls=], and Blocklist%0a%0a* To list all the groups in a site, try [[PmWiki/Search | searching]] for "[[{$FullName}?action=search&q=fmt%253Dgroup|fmt=group]]".%0a* To list all the pages in a group, try [[PmWiki/Search | searching]] for "[[{$FullName}?action=search&q={$Group}%252F|GroupName/]]".%0a%0a[[#specialpages]]%0a!! [[(PmWiki:)Special Pages]] in a Group%0aBy default, the ''[[Recent Changes]]'' page of each group shows only the pages that have changed within that group; the ''[[Site.All Recent Changes]]'' page shows all pages that have changed in all groups.%0a%0aEach group can also have ''[[Group Header(s)]]'' or ''Group Footer'' pages that contain text to be automatically prepended or appended to every page in the group.  A group can also have a ''Group Attributes ''page that defines attributes (read and edit passwords) shared by all pages within the group.  %0a%0aEach page can also have its own individual read/edit password that overrides the group passwords (see [[Passwords]]).%0a%0aFinally, [[wiki administrator]]s can set [[local customizations]] on a per-group basis--see [[Group Customizations]].%0a%0a[[#groupdefaultpage]]%0a!! Group's default page%0a%0aThe default "start page" for a group is a page whose name is: %0a# the same as the group (Foo/Foo)%0a# HomePage (Foo/HomePage)%0a# a name that the administrator has assigned to the [={$DefaultName}=] variable in the configuration.php file.  %0a%0aNote, on this site, the value of [={$DefaultName}=] is ''{$DefaultName}'' and, thus, the default home page would be Foo/{$DefaultName}.   %0a%0aYou can usefully change the default ''search'' order for an entered page name by setting the variable @@$PagePathFmt @@ in @@config.php@@, eg%0a-> @@ $PagePathFmt = array('$Group.$1', '$1.$DefaultName', '$1.$1', '$DefaultGroup.$1', 'Profiles.$1'); @@%0awhere "$1" is the name of the page entered. %0a%0aAs noted above, when linking to the default home page, authors can omit the page name and simply identify the group followed by a  forward slash ([=[[Foo/]]=]).%0a%0aNote the forward slash is required to ensure that the link unambiguously points to the identified group.  %0aIf the slash is omitted, the link can end up being interpreted as pointing to an existing (or new) page in the current group (if the group, or its default home page, do not exist).  %0a%0a!! Subgroups? Subpages?%0aNo, PmWiki does not have subpages.  Pm's reasons for not having subgroups are described at [[PmWiki:Hierarchical Groups]], but it comes down to not having a good page linking syntax.  If you create a link or pagename like [@[[A.B.C]]@] PmWiki doesn't think of "B.C" as being in group "A", it instead thinks of "C" as being in group "AB", which is a separate group from "A".  Wiki administrators can look at [[Cookbook:Subgroup Markup]] and [[Cookbook:Include With Edit]] for recipes that may be of some help with developing subgroups or subpages.%0a%0a!! Restricting the creation of new groups%0aYou can set PmWiki's $GroupPattern variable to only accept the group names you want to define. For example, to limit pages to the "PmWiki", "Main", "Profiles", and "Example" groups, add the following to local/config.php:%0a%0a-> $GroupPattern = '(?:Site|SiteAdmin|PmWiki|Main|Profiles|Example)';%0a%0aWith this setting, only the listed groups will be considered valid WikiGroups. You can add more groups to the list by placing additional group names separated by pipes (|).%0a%0aSee other solutions to this at [[Cookbook:Limit Wiki Groups]] and [[Cookbook:New Group Warning]].%0a%0a>>faq%3c%3c [[#faq]]%0aQ: How can I get rid of the 'Main' group in urls for pages pointing to Main?%0a%0aA: See [[Cookbook:Get Rid Of Main]].%0a%0aQ: How can I limit the creation of new groups?%0a%0aA: See [[Cookbook:Limit Wiki Groups]].%0a%0aQ: Why doesn't [=[[St. Giles and St. James]]=] work as a link?  (It doesn't display anything.)%0a%0aA: Because it contains periods, and destroys PmWiki's file structure, which saves pages as [=Group.PageName=]. Adding those periods disrupts this format. Links may only contain words. If you need a link precisely as shown, the page must be named eg StGilesAndStJames then you can use the [=(:title:)=] directive to have the page's title appear with periods [=(:title St. Giles and St. James:)=]. (Although in US grammar the period is often omitted and in UK grammar the period [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation|must be]] omitted for contractions like St).%0a%0aQ: How can I delete a wiki group?%0a%0aA: Normally you can't, as this requires an admin with server-side access to delete the file that makes up the group's RecentChanges page.  But there is an option method of making it possible to delete RecentChanges pages from within the wiki if the admin enables the code found on [[Cookbook:RecentChanges Deletion]].%0a%0aQ: How can I delete a wiki group's Group.RecentChanges page?%0a%0aA: Normally you can't, as this requires an admin with server-side access to delete a file.
