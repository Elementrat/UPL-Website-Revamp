text=(:Summary:The if directive allows portions of a page to be included or excluded from rendering:)%0a%25define=indent block margin-left=2em%25%0a(:Audience: authors, admins (advanced) :)%0a!! Using the [=(:if:)=] Directive%0aThe [@(:if:)@] directive allows portions of a page to be included or %0aexcluded from rendering.  The generic forms of the [@(:if:)@] directive are%0a%0a-> [@(:if cond param:) body (:ifend:)@]%0a-> [@(:if cond param:) body (:else:) body (:ifend:)@]%0a-> [@(:if cond param:) body (:elseif cond param:) body (:ifend:)@]%0a%0awhere "cond" names a condition to be tested, and "param" is a parameter or other argument to the condition.%0a%0a''Note that [@(:if:)@] without parameters and [@(:ifend:)@] are identical. Also note that [@(:if cond:)@] automatically closes a previous conditional. For nested multiple levels, see [[#nested-conditions|Nested conditionals]].''%0a%0a!! Built-in Conditions [[#built-in-conditions]]%0aThe built-in conditions include:%0a%0a(:table class='indent' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if name PAGENAME:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)current page is named "[@PAGENAME@]"%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if group GROUPNAME:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)current group is named "[@GROUPNAME@]"%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if auth LEVEL PAGENAME:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)viewer is authorized - meaning "what they are allowed to do" - matches a "[@LEVEL@]" where [@LEVEL@] can be: [@read@], [@edit@], [@upload@], [@attr@] or [@admin@]; [@PAGENAME@] is optional.%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if authid:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)current viewer is authenticated - meaning they have proven who they are via login - to use this the wiki must include recipe [[PmWiki/AuthUser|AuthUser]] or others which set the [@$AuthId@] variable.%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if enabled InvalidLogin:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)username and password not authenticated.

(Note that [@VALUE@] can be a recognizable date via strtotime() whereas DATE [or DATE1 and DATE2 below] have a more fixed format which explicitly must exclude spaces.  Any spaces in DATE1 or DATE2 cause unpredictable results.)%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if date DATE..

Nesting Conditions [[#nested-conditions]]%0aNote that [@(:if cond:)@] automatically closes a previous conditional.

To have nested conditionals you need to number the if, and the matching else/ifend:%0a->[@%0a(:if cond1:)%0a  cond1 is true%0a  (:if2 cond2:)%0a     cond1 and cond2 are true%0a  (:else2:)%0a     cond1 is true, cond2 is not%0a  (:if2end:)%0a(:else:)%0a  cond1 is false, cond2 testing was ignored%0a(:ifend:)%0a@]%0a[-''Spaces were added for better readability.''-]%0a%0a!!

Combining conditions%0aConditions (as previously defined) may be combined into more complex conditional expressions using one of these three equivalent forms:%0a%0a->[@%0a(:if expr EXPRESSION :)%0a(:if [ EXPRESSION ] :)%0a(:if ( EXPRESSION ) :)@]%0a%0aConditions are combined into expressions with boolean operators and brackets. In the next table, A and B are either regular conditions or (round-)bracketed sub-expressions of regular conditions:%0a%0a>>indent%3c%3c%0a|| border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0%0a||! Expression ||! Operator ||!
