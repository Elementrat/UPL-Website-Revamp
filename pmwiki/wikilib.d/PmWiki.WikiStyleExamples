text=(:Summary: Styling text for colour and other attributes:)%0aSee also [[Cookbook:WikiStylesPlus | Wiki Styles Plus]] and [[(PmWiki:)Wiki style colors]].%0a%0aPmWiki uses [[WikiStyles]] for styling text with color and other attributes.  PmWiki 2.0 introduced the ability to control the styling further and to even place styles on blocks.%0a%0aA  style is specified within a pair of %25-signs and styles the text that follows, as in:%0a%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0aThis text is %25color=red%25 red, %25color=blue%25 blue, %25%25 and normal (black).%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aThere are a wide number of available style properties, borrowed primarily from HTML and CSS.  In addition, an author can define a style "shortcut" by using the [@define=@] property.  For example, to define a style of [@%25red%25@], one can use:%0a%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0a%25define=mystyle color=red%25%0aHere is some %25mystyle%25 red text created using a style shortcut.%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aShortcuts can be combined with other styles, including other shortcuts:%0a%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0a%25define=lovelyred color=red%25%0a%25define=likegrapefruit bgcolor=yellow%25%0a%0a%25red%25 This text is red, %25red bgcolor=#ccc%25 red on a grey background, and %25lovelyred likegrapefruit%25 red on a yellow background.  %0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aSo far, this is all basically the same as what was available in PmWiki 1.0.  PmWiki 2.0 includes the capability to style blocks, by using the [@apply=@] style property.  Specifying [@apply=block@] in a `WikiStyle will cause that style to be applied to the entire block, instead of just the text that follows:%0a%0a(:markup:)%0aThis entire block %25apply=block bgcolor=yellow%25 has a yellow background, even though the `WikiStyle appears in the middle of the line.  %25bgcolor=pink%25 Other inline (non-block) WikiStyles can appear in the middle of the line,%25%25 as before.%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aThis means it's now possible to do right-aligned and centered text:%0a%0a(:markup:)%0a%25block text-align=right%25 The text of this paragraph is right-aligned. %0a%0a%25block text-align=center%25 The text of this paragraph is centered.  %0a(:markupend:)%0a%0a%0aIn fact, PmWiki predefines [@%25right%25@] and [@%25center%25@] style shortcuts so that you can do this more simply:%0a%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0a%25right%25 This is right-aligned.%0a%0a%25center%25 This is centered.%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aAuthors can define their own custom styles:%0a%0a(:markup:)%0a%25define=Pm block bgcolor=#fdf%25%0a%25define=goofy center bgcolor=#dfd border='3px dotted green'%25%0a%25define=rediguana right bgcolor=#ffffcc border='1px dotted red' padding=5px%25%0a%25define=strike text-decoration=line-through%25%0a%0a%25Pm%25 Any text that is on a light purple background is a comment from "Pm".%0a%0a%25goofy%25 Here's some text from Goofy.%0a%0a%25rediguana%25 bla bla by rediguana!%0a%0a%25goofy%25Hello, I am %25strike%25upset%25%25 %25strike%25disheartened%25%25 happy to meet you.%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aStyles can be applied to almost any kind of block:%0a%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0a* %25block bgcolor=yellow%25 Here is a list item%0a* Here's another list item%0a%0a* Here's more of a list%0a%0a# A new list%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aIn particular, this means that outlines are now possible using the predefined [@%25ROMAN%25@], [@%25roman%25@], [@%25ALPHA%25@], and [@%25alpha%25@] list-block styles.  The style has to be specified on the first item in the list (and we may develop an alternate syntax for this sort of ordered list):%0a%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0a# %25ROMAN%25 Top level%0a## %25ALPHA%25 second-level%0a## second-level%0a## second-level%0a### third-level%0a### third-level%0a## second-level%0a### third-level%0a#### %25alpha%25 fourth-level%0a##### %25roman%25 fifth-level%0a##### fifth-level%0a#### fourth-level%0a# top-level%0a# top-level%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0a[[Wiki styles]] can be combined with CSS stylesheets to do this automatically -- see [[Cookbook:OutlineLists]].%0a%0a%0a!!
